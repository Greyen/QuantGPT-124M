1 - size_t is an unsigned integer type in C that is used to represent the size of objects in memory.
  - It is the result type of sizeof operator.
  - ex 
    int array[10];
    size_t size = sizeof(array);
2 - typedef struct Embedding {
        int rows;
        int col;
        float* data;
    } Embedding;

    You create a structure named Embedding (tag name).

    You also make a shortcut using typedef so you can write:Embedding e;

    I can use both struct Embedding e1; // works , Embedding e2 //works; 

  - typedef struct {
        int rows;
        int col;
        float* data;
    } Embedding;
    
    What this does:

    You create a structure with no name (anonymous struct).

    But typedef gives it a shortcut name Embedding.

    Embedding e;          // works ✅  , struct ??? e;         // ❌ doesn't work (no struct name)
